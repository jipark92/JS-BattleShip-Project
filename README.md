Objective: 

    - Build the classic Battle Ship game.
 
Instruction:

    - 2. Press RANDOM to set your ships at randomized location.
    - 3. Press START to start the game!

    Notes:
    - Player 1 always goes first. 
    - Player 1 vs Player 2 mode hides all ships.
        - pretty much a guessing game.
    - Other buttons are disabled until you select the game mode.
    - Computer is broken but it still functions.
